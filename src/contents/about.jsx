  description: `This website is my personal space to document what I build and what I learn.

I come from a software development background and am currently focusing on
quality assurance, API testing, and system validation to better understand
how real-world systems behave in production.

I enjoy breaking things (intentionally), asking “what if?”, and improving
software quality through structured testing and technical understanding.`,
